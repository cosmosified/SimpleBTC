Simplecoin Web Mining Framework

Requirements:
Simplecoin relies on an existing and working bitcoin and pushpool installation. Before attempting to run simplecoin, please setup the following.
Bitcoin: bitcoin.org
Pushpool: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=8707.0


Installation:
1. Extract files into web root directory
2. Create simplecoin database in you mysql instance
3. Run simplecoin.sql in your simplecoin database (This will be used for pushpool & simplcoin)
4. Edit includes/requiredFunctions.php and set the bitcoin & database login info
5. Edit all files in the cronjob folder, set $includesDirectory to the correct server path.
6. setup cronjobs on a staggered schedule. I recommend 10-30 minutes for most. I run payout twice daily.
